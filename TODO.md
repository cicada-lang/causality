- build a causal inference engine for real valued random variables first.

- try to model a system of random variables
  - review `docs/articles/random-variables.md`
  - a `Sample` class?

- A good API for working with (directed) graph.

- Thinking about structural causal model,
  what if the functions are symbolic instead of numerical,
  we can use pattern matching to do queries,
  just like we can use inequality to do queries for numerical function.

- Survey classical expert systems.

# learn

- Read "Causality -- Models, Reasoning and Inference".
