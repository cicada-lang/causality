- setup typescript project

- try to model a system of random variables
  - a `Sample` class?

- Read "Patterns of Plausible Inference"

- In constructive logic, a proof is an evidence about the truth of a proposition,
  in probability theory, we also have evidences, just the evidence are not decisive,
  but only changing we degree of belief of the proposition.

  We need a calculus of evidences.

  - Is Bayes networks a calculus of evidences?
    - We might observe more `{ A: ..., B: ... }` or `{ A: ... }`.
      What is the form of evidence?
    - Think about Polya's book, it seems has more complicate evidences.

  - A database of evidences.
    - Like the PLANNER language?

  - It seems logic is the key, which can connect many domain of study.

    - type theory.
    - probability.
    - computation -- SAT solver.

- Read "Causality -- Models, Reasoning and Inference".
  - How tools and API are needed in statistics and probability theory?

  - Design a probabilistic programming language.
  - Find a interesting dataset to practice.
