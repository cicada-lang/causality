title: Causal Inference Engine
---

# NOTE

- Patterns and correlations are about intuition,
  causality is about the model.

- Maybe I can write a book with Dan on this topic.

  - There are so many good puzzles in this topic.

- When studying the topic, I should view the above as a goal.

- If causal model + feedback loop = dynamic system model,
  maybe we should implement dynamic system model directly.

# TODO

- What would a Causal Inference Engine be like?

- What are the first steps to build a Causal Inference Engine?

- Can we use TDD for the API design?

- Is it possible to implement the Causal Inference Engine as two parts,

  - one for graph and do calculus
  - one for random variable
