# Evidence in constructive logic and statistics

In constructive logic, a proof is an evidence about the truth of a proposition,
in probability theory, we also have evidences, just the evidence are not decisive,
but only changing we degree of belief of the proposition.

We need a calculus of evidences.

- Is Bayes networks a calculus of evidences?

  - We might observe more `{ A: ..., B: ... }` or `{ A: ... }`.

    If we view evidence as observing more and more objects,
    what is the form of direct evidence of a conditional proposition `B -> A`,
    which increase `P(A | B)`?

    Is `B` merely a space for indexing,
    and evidence of `A` is evidence of a dependent type?

  - Think about Polya's book, it seems has more complicate evidences.

    If we are not sure about `A`,
    but we have proof of `A -> B` and proof of `B`,
    are't these proofs evidence of `A`?

    The above inference is an abduction,
    so evidence with uncertainty is constructed by
    abduction and induction?

- A database of evidences.

  - Like the PLANNER language?

- It seems logic is the key, which can connect many domain of study.

  - type theory.
  - probability.
  - computation -- SAT solver.
